# ProfitSplitters
## Overview
For this project I've created 3 smart contracts that can be used automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

* `AssociateProfitSplitter` - This contract will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level emplayees. This will allow the HR department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.
* `TieredProfitSplitter` - Distributes different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.
* `DeferredEquityPlan` - This contract models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.
